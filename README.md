# Amazon Sales Report Analysis

## Introduction
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Amazon sales dataset, focusing on sales performance, product distribution, fulfillment methods, customer segmentation, and geographical analysis. The objective is to extract actionable insights to support business decision-making.

## Data Cleaning

### Initial Inspection
The dataset contains various columns including order details, product information, shipping details, and fulfillment methods. The initial inspection revealed several columns with missing values, particularly:
- `currency` and `Amount`
- `ship-city`, `ship-state`, `ship-postal-code`, and `ship-country`
- `fulfilled-by`
- `New` and `PendingS`

### Cleaning Steps
1. **Dropped Irrelevant Columns**: Columns `New` and `PendingS` were dropped due to a very high number of missing values.
2. **Handled Missing Values**:
   - Investigated the relationship between missing `currency`/`Amount` and order `Status`. Most missing values corresponded to `Cancelled` orders.
   - Removed rows with missing shipping details.
3. **Removed `Cancelled` Orders**: These orders do not contribute to sales and were removed from the dataset.
